    1. Program that adds periods/elipses midsentence after a half a second or more of waiting; the goal is to mimic real life pauses so you're incentivized to think of the sentence before you write it. To get into the technicalities of it, you could stop the periods through a designated key that you normally wouldnt use (e.g. %) to signify the end of a sentence, and the periods start after the keyboard is left alone for a half second or more. This could be abused by someone typing a letter and hitting backspace repeatedly while they're thinking, but backspaces could also be punished somehow
Example of what a sentence might look like:
"I went to the...market today...and I....saw the...weirdest thing."
