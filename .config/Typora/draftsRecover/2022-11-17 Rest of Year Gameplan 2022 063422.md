-Ability to quickly and easily combine notes of the same category
-Autowriting the date created (month/day) with the correct markdown heading format on the first line of the note
-Autotranscribe YT link title to help remember what the video was if taken down
Either have better workflow on just phone through XR assistance/foldable phone, or improve integration with working on computer (#1 problem is Obsidian's tendency to delete file content when connecting to comp or accessing files simultaneously on phone + comp)
Switch to Proton Mail app/Tutanota

Online tourneys:

Monday: None of significance

Tuesday: None of significance

Wednesday: Coinbox, $2000 pot (paid entry) / Fight or Flight, $20/ pot

Thursday: SmU5h, $20 pot / Just Tech It, $20/10 pot

Friday: Magical Outlaws, $15 pot / The Dong, $10/5 pot

Saturday: GGToor, $100 pot (free entry) / Victory Road, $65/35/10 pot

Sunday: Smash Station, $5-$20 for first (payout doesn't scale well)

To win the tourneys that are way more rewarding than locals, I will be competing against top 200 or greater skill level. Easier to get the same payout from winning a small local as getting 7th at a tier1/tier2 online tourney, but online tourneys obviously have bigger rewards if you get past 7th. 1st of the Coinbox gets $800, but you'll likely have to fight either Sparg0, Sonix, or Maister, which are top 20-30 level

Any tourney with a 1st place prize of less than $20 is prob not worth. Instead of playing in laggy tourneys with variable outcomes, I could DoorDash that day for a more efficient payout per hr

There are a bunch of recurring tourneys with 1st prizes of $20 or less, but the money is moreso in the big weeklies (e.g. the Coinbox) or in special events, like JaidenAnimation's Ridley tourney. Usually it's the Mexican players that snipe tourneys that pay $30 or less to the winner, since USD is more valuable there
