How could you turn cars into Faraday cages? How would it be possible to switch between turning the wireless communication ‚Äúfirewall‚Äù on and off? Some wireless communication from inside the car would be necessary if you wanted to use your phone to connect to the Internet/other phones, but you perhaps could use something like an antennae on the outside and then connect that to an internal system like the head unit.

Future of mobile word processing?
...
Using correct punctuation on mobile is very annoying. Imagine having to lift up your laptop keyboard every time you wanted to use an apostrophe.
Fast typing on mobile interface
The current interface largely sucks. It's cumbersome, very easy to misinput, and way slower than typing with a physical keyboard
Voice typing seems meh. It's hard to edit with voice typing
Im so prone to typos when typing on my phone, it's so frustrating and inefficient
It's still a relatively new tech I guess, but billions of people have this same issue

## Health
https://apexdentaliowa.com/jaw-and-facial-development-in-adults/
‚ÄúOral posture (lips together, tongue on palate, teeth together) is largely responsible for the normal growth and development of the face and jaws. The tongue is a powerful muscle and should rest against the upper palate (roof of mouth) and cause the upper jaw to broaden and grow forward in the healthy and aesthetically appealing manner. When this does not happen, because of tongue tie and/or open mouth posture, the midface does not grow properly and the lower jaw is typically trapped behind a deficient upper jaw and midface.‚Äù
Research to support tongue-tie procedure as necessary? Otherwise research cost of ‚Äútongue-tie/ankyloglossia release‚Äù

## Cull
    1. Program that adds periods/elipses midsentence after a half a second or more of waiting; the goal is to mimic real life pauses so you're incentivized to think of the sentence before you write it. To get into the technicalities of it, you could stop the periods through a designated key that you normally wouldnt use (e.g. %) to signify the end of a sentence, and the periods start after the keyboard is left alone for a half second or more. This could be abused by someone typing a letter and hitting backspace repeatedly while they're thinking, but backspaces could also be punished somehow
Example of what a sentence might look like:
"I went to the...market today...and I....saw the...weirdest thing."

"Proper disposal of used cooking oil is an important waste-management concern. Oil can congeal in pipes, provoking blockages.I[103]
Because of this, cooking oil should never be dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl. The proper way to dispose of oil is to put it in a sealed non-recyclable container and discard it with regular garbage.[104] Placing the container of oil in the refrigerator to harden alsomakes disposal easier and  less messy."

I seem to be somewhere between -4 and -6 diopters (17-25cm/7-10 inches)
If I want to practice print-pushing, the library seats with study dividers in every direction, an adjustable desk, and a foot cushion is my best bet. The desk is probably adjustable enough to place it in my edge of focus, which would be 7-10 inches.
Test 10/19/21: ~22-28cm = Between ~-3.5 and -4.5 diopters. Tested on max brightness laptop in the booth nearest to the front entrance with the booth‚Äôs light on.
If I want more accurate measurements, I should keep consistent lighting conditions. Therefore I should conduct all future tests in the ‚ÄúQuiet Room‚Äù of AKS, on max brightness of my laptop.
Test 12/9/21: 29-31cm = Between ~-3.25 and -3.5 diopters.
Goal is to reach -2.5 diopters/39cm, because this is the distance I can start comfortably using my laptop without glasses
If I keep a steady rate of -.25 diopters every 2 months (which is an underestimated projection of my current progress), then I can reach -2.5 by August 2022. I would also probably need a new pair of underprescribed glasses along the way, because being way overprescribed will probably interfere with my progress.
