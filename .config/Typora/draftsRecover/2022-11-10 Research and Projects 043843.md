How could you turn cars into Faraday cages? How would it be possible to switch between turning the wireless communication “firewall” on and off? Some wireless communication from inside the car would be necessary if you wanted to use your phone to connect to the Internet/other phones, but you perhaps could use something like an antennae on the outside and then connect that to an internal system like the head unit.

Hypothesis: Places that have high turnover rates have information plastered all over the place (e.g., Publix Deli, elementary school classrooms, the guest services desk at the Coalition for the Homeless’s Center for Women and Families

https://apexdentaliowa.com/jaw-and-facial-development-in-adults/
“Oral posture (lips together, tongue on palate, teeth together) is largely responsible for the normal growth and development of the face and jaws. The tongue is a powerful muscle and should rest against the upper palate (roof of mouth) and cause the upper jaw to broaden and grow forward in the healthy and aesthetically appealing manner. When this does not happen, because of tongue tie and/or open mouth posture, the midface does not grow properly and the lower jaw is typically trapped behind a deficient upper jaw and midface.”
Research to support tongue-tie procedure as necessary? Otherwise research cost of “tongue-tie/ankyloglossia release”

Idea: XR visualizer for online products
You know how people wont wanna order stuff like furniture or clothing online because it turns out bigger or smaller than they picture?
Or how going in person to shop for furniture is hard because it's hard to visualize how well it would fit in your environment back home?
Or how people have a hard time finding something in a store even though they know the store has it and they know what it looks like because they dont know how big or small the item is?

This idea would simplify that. Instead of do one of the above, or calculate a visualization using the object dimensions, just have a bot do it for you

Box meta

YouTube-specific videos
-Falcon metagame with Fatality and Coach Tony
-Philosophy on why we play Smash. Address the doubts many people have of it being a children's party game
"The deepest meaning of Smash"/"Smash - More than a Game" Refer to Creation of Consciousness Jung book
-Why I voluntarily lived in my car ("I lived in my car and played Smash for 6 months. This is how")
How good is box

Warrior Mindset - why you should play Steve, and why I'm not going to

Music:
-Playing the music I want during stream is a necessity, so might need to record custom music from other audio to avoid copyright when uploading to YT
-Alternatively, ignore copyright and fund my stuff via membership platform like Patreon or Gumroad

Self-aware content farming like Sam

Dance carnival

Extremely condensed SFX soundboard, like the really fast audience applause from Signs from Godrilla

Surreal and ironic but true and beautiful twist on modern YT meta, like Shorts and Reaction Videos
