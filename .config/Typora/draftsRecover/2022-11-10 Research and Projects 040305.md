How can we turn brown grease (the used cooking oil we use in the deli) into something useful?

"Proper disposal of used cooking oil is an important waste-management concern. Oil can congeal in pipes, provoking blockages.I[103]
Because of this, cooking oil should never be dumped in the kitchen sink or in the toilet bowl. The proper way to dispose of oil is to put it in a sealed non-recyclable container and discard it with regular garbage.[104] Placing the container of oil in the refrigerator to harden alsomakes disposal easier and  less messy."

I seem to be somewhere between -4 and -6 diopters (17-25cm/7-10 inches)
If I want to practice print-pushing, the library seats with study dividers in every direction, an adjustable desk, and a foot cushion is my best bet. The desk is probably adjustable enough to place it in my edge of focus, which would be 7-10 inches.
Test 10/19/21: ~22-28cm = Between ~-3.5 and -4.5 diopters. Tested on max brightness laptop in the booth nearest to the front entrance with the booth’s light on.
If I want more accurate measurements, I should keep consistent lighting conditions. Therefore I should conduct all future tests in the “Quiet Room” of AKS, on max brightness of my laptop.
Test 12/9/21: 29-31cm = Between ~-3.25 and -3.5 diopters.
Goal is to reach -2.5 diopters/39cm, because this is the distance I can start comfortably using my laptop without glasses
If I keep a steady rate of -.25 diopters every 2 months (which is an underestimated projection of my current progress), then I can reach -2.5 by August 2022. I would also probably need a new pair of underprescribed glasses along the way, because being way overprescribed will probably interfere with my progress.

https://apexdentaliowa.com/jaw-and-facial-development-in-adults/
“Oral posture (lips together, tongue on palate, teeth together) is largely responsible for the normal growth and development of the face and jaws. The tongue is a powerful muscle and should rest against the upper palate (roof of mouth) and cause the upper jaw to broaden and grow forward in the healthy and aesthetically appealing manner. When this does not happen, because of tongue tie and/or open mouth posture, the midface does not grow properly and the lower jaw is typically trapped behind a deficient upper jaw and midface.”

Idea: XR visualizer for online products
You know how people wont wanna order stuff like furniture or clothing online because it turns out bigger or smaller than they picture?

Or how people have a hard time finding something in a store even though they know the store has it and they know what it looks like because they dont know how big or small the item is?

This idea would simplify that. Instead of do one of the above, or calculate a visualization using the object dimensions, just have a bot do it for you
