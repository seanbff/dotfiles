## January
### Jan 1
I’m interested in books on hoarding psychology, with a preference for psychoanalysis and hypnosis. I’d like to get an idea of what being a hoarder feels like, similar to how I developed empathy for Ryan’s disorders from *Picky Eater* and Economakis.
https://hbmag.com/hoarding-a-jungian-perspective/
“Recent research on hoarding suggests that people who hoard have a difficult time distinguishing between the relative value of things, so they save everything.”
Makes sense, because it aligns with my experience with my mother over getting rid of Star Wars toys.
But why? I may just find an answer that says, “Well it’s just naturally found in the neurotic and the creative”, but let’s go beyond psychometric explanation.
And is there a difference between men and women? It would intuitively make sense for it to be primarily found in women because the feminine essence is fundamentally a dissolution of boundaries

I feel like Sasuke recovering in Orochimaru’s lair

### Jan 4
I could see how science could be viewed as Satanic because it is fundamentally an investigation into the material world, which was damned by the church when alchemy originated
To see the predominant worldview become postmodern reductionist could be a result of going too far into the scientific (or Satanic) and a return to the holy (discovered through psychedelia) being desperately needed
This explanation could explain my interest in psychedelia from a young age if I had recognized traces of a coming Woke-ism storm
Wouldn’t it be interesting if the primary force behind the divorce crisis and the disempowerment of fathers was directly related to the rise of Woke, or CSJ? If true, it would make sense for me to deal with the problem by exploring psychedelics

### Jan 6
I feel like I need new friends.
...
With reference to that Genius commenter that interpreted Bladee’s Apple as the world going to become revolutionarily better in 2020, they may not be wrong. At first, I thought it was a ridiculous claim because so many people have suffered. But then I looked at it from another way: we’re cleaning our room, and things must get messier before they get cleaner.
Our language (e.g. English shifting to “E-Prime”), our mode of reality (VR + internet manifested in vandwelling + Starlink), and our understanding of the world may all radically change for the better. Institutions like universities may be irreversibly falling apart in their current form for good reason: because something better to replace it is coming.
This appears to be the act of faith that Peterson refers to. Every time we venture into chaos, or dissolve ourselves, there is always the real possibility of death. Even something as mundane as driving to the grocery store carries the chance of getting into a fatal car accident.
Likewise, humanity facing one of its greatest times of chaos carries the chance of being wiped out as a species, by all kinds of threats. AI. Nuclear power. Poor internet design leading to polarization. To claim that humanity may emerge out of this crisis may even be considered arrogant. But it’s less an arrogance, and more of a faith. The faith is necessary to keep us going. It’s a hope.
On a deeper level, the faith that we shall always come together again after falling apart may hold as a universal truth if we consider “ourselves” to be spirits or God themselves, instead of merely human.

### Jan 7
Having better communicative tools on the road (i.e., having a tool other than using a horn to scream at others) was prob one of my better inventive ideas

### Jan 9
If the positive feedback loop/conspiracy between my mother and aunt is broken, it may be possible for the Holy Trinity as discussed by JP in “Society Forgot This about the Role of the Mother” to occur. Growing a relationship with Jeff and Ryan graduating high school may help with this
How does Link beat Twinrova? I’m not trying to kill Mom and Mary, but the evil/hellish aspect of them. “Nefarious Housewives”
According to the Zelda wiki, Link defeats Twinrova by reflecting the opposites into the other (e.g. using Mirror Shield to throw Koume’s fire spell at Kotake)
...
“Strong natures -- or should one rather call them weak? -- do not like to be reminded of this, but prefer to think of themselves as heroes who are beyond good and evil, and to cut the Gordian knot instead of untying it. Nevertheless, the account has to be settled sooner or later. In the end, one has to admit that there are problems, which one simply cannot solve on one’s own resources. Such an admission has the advantage of being honest, truthful, and in accord with reality, and this prepares the ground for a compensatory reaction from the collective unconscious: you are now more inclined to give heed to a helpful idea or intuition, or to notice thoughts which had not been allowed to voice themselves before.”
I was reminded of my father’s character tendencies reading the first sentence
...
I could consider my early life as an overprotected child who played Zelda games and lived in a self-created Nintendo sanctuary to be an extended tutorial I took about how to be a hero, and I’m finally beginning to live it.
I can consider myself grateful if this pathway is analogous to choosing late game rewards that stack on top of each other, like Spectre in Dota2 or a Lvl3 Penguin in Super Auto Pets

Why does Tarin from Link’s Awakening turn into a raccoon when he eats a mushroom?
...
“War is father of all, and King of all” - Heraclitus
...
Though deeply disappointed that I didn’t get to try mushrooms, the fact that Trey lost them could mean something. It could mean that now is not the right time, it could mean that I don’t need them to achieve a spiritual experience (I was reminded of my personal beginnings of visions with  the Ganzfield experiments, for example), and it could draw my attention to the fact that Trey is incredibly disorganized. I was pretty shocked by the terribly disorganized contents of his drawers as he fished through them. It reminded me of trying to look for the dish scraper under a heap of kitchen dishes at Publix, but Trey had like 15 of those heaps. It was stressful just watching him, because due to the chaos the likelihood of thoroughly looking through the area the first time and confidently seal it off as a possibility is low. This meant that he kept returning to drawers that he checked before, resulting in a loop that didn’t have a foreseeable end.
Why is he like this? It may be inherited, since I remember his house being the same way, but why were his parents like that?
And now that I thin of it, most of the friends I have/had live in relatively disorganized living spaces. Trey, Tony, Lucas, Erik, Josh, Heather, both exes (not as sure about Avery.) Maybe I have a new perspective because I changed a lot in the last couple years, but the living spaces of these people seem disgusting and dysfunctional compared to the more successful people I know (Mary and Jeff, Tom + Cathy, my father, Jarrett my old roommate, Alex my childhood friend, etc.)
...
It appears that Ludwig and my friend Owen like to frequently swap the intonation of questions and statements. E.g. “I’m throwing/” sounds like a question and “What should I do\” sounds like a statement
Why are they doing this and what similarities do these people share? My imagination says they’re both white guys from wealthy backgrounds
...
Peco tear Paddle My body
Refer to Ping Pong scene of Peco tearing pieces of his paddle off as he gets frustrated by Sakuma: This reminds me of how I often compulsively pick at my face or at acne on my arms/back, especially when stressed. Why does this phenomenon occur? Why does it make sense for Peco to destroy his paddle in response to an external frustration?

### Jan 10
One positive aspect of COVID is that it has somewhat shoehorned the reluctant into the Internet, and entrenched the familiar even further. I theorize that “The Great Resignation” that occurred during this time has led to those who quit having a higher vested interest in the metaverse. 
...
If copyright law is what’s standing in the way of better Smash (modded games like PM), why not target that instead of just playing Smash and creating awareness about copyright?
A solution to copyright would be an infrastructure that’s more valuable for corps to release copyright and collaborate than to cling to it. We seem to be making headway with observations of games like Fortnite now having Naruto, Travis Scott, and much more
A possible solution might be replacing the concept of IPs with NFTs. Making memes into currency, for example

A 3D printed nose piece would solve the problem of how frustrating it is to assemble. My current setup is like having to carve a wooden fork that breaks if I even look at it the wrong way every time I want to eat.
Where can I borrow a 3D printer?
It seems that places like Staples and UPS offer printing services, with a standard of $1/hr. Since I estimate it will only take an hour or two to print, this seems much cheaper than anticipated
...
It appears that when Smash reaches higher levels of play, it will resemble something more like Street Fighter or Tekken. It may be a testament to Smash’s complexity that the concept of resetting neutral when a string ends and playing any kind of neutral that isn’t rushdown is foreign to many Ult players and most Melee players, ~20-25 years into the game

It’s kind of cool to see that I’m part of “The Great Quit”/”The Great Resignation”
On one hand, I feel less special, but on the other hand, it makes it easier to explain my story to other people because it allows me to nest my story within a larger picture
Also, Boomer TV has such slow speech

Tweet title: THE TRUTH...REVEALED?
I can announce my return to Twitter. Ultimately decided that although Twitter sucks, there is no better alternative atm and I can put up with what currently exists. Furthermore, I can use Twitter not only as future marketing for employment as a Smashlete but additionally as a freelancer or streamer. Streaming may not be my first choice, but it sure as hell beats working at Publix.
I can frame my Twitlonger as not a pity-soliciting tragedy, but as an epic, in a tone that is encouraging of spirit and dreams.
“As some of you are aware, I recently started attending tourneys again in the last few months.”
...
The so-called “shithead” part of me is actually the provocative, and therefore in a sense, masculine part of me that I’ve inherited from my dad. Though not like JP, Link, or Christ, there is an obnoxious part of me that refuses to go away, and can still be integrated into a hero figure, like Naruto
It doesn’t appear to be a consciously designed persona, either, because I often enjoy being incredibly obnoxious in private. (Tony has an obvious distaste for it, but he’s kind of a cuck)
Though unlike Naruto, I also have the shy, introspective, polite, pussy side of me that I learned from being raised by a single mother. These are the two personalities that Tony says I coinflip between. The challenge is to integrate these opposites, or else I stay acting like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
The solution to this is found in the individual but manifests at the larger level. Meaning I can solve my parents divorce, and at large the dissolution of the patriarchal force, if I integrate my opposing personalities. One person that I’ve been studying for ideas is Aris (his flaw is that he isn’t honest, but he’s great at being disagreeable in a way that people like or are fine with.)
So, I suppose it’s been too general to say I don’t like conflict, evidenced by my obnoxious outbursts and passive aggressive tendencies. Also worth noting that my pussy side speaks in white folk (proper English, used by the likes of JP and Tony) and rachet black niggas (Ebonics.)
Silence is truth (the void is everything and nothing), but being silent’s for pussies. The quantum realm reminds us of our infinite possibility but staying there leads to a lack of embodiment of any possibility
![](./.media/tweet_stuff.png)
Black people are basically assuming the role of Christ’s shadow, or Satan. This makes intuitive sense because they identify with Naruto, a character that as mentioned earlier, does not match most Christ-like figures.

### Jan 11
How is the internet dealing with hiding of the personality beyond persona? Everything can be recorded and echoed infinitely. Tony’s solution is to just never emerge from the shell (never says any curse words online, with the extreme of the idea being to never utter a curse word ever) but to do that is to never live
...
Critique of Wilson’s “War on Is” (from Quantum Psychology)
Though people often generalize from binary “is” logic with hazardous results (e.g. maybe a person becomes anorexic because someone says they’re fat), but Wilson seems to have a fundamental misconception about the word’s use.
“Is” is a magical tool that manifests a single reality from a sea of infinite possibility. It is the tool of the masculine that turns nothing into something. Like how words circle around the truth, to use the word “is” is not to claim knowledge of true reality. I see Wilson’s point, because it’s important to remember that one is not the only (this is the lesson of hypnosis and “opening up your mind”), but this is moreso to do with generalizing words, like never and always.
Though I like the idea of challenging the status quo of language, the book appears to simply be an idealist’s lament. I think real changes manifest at the individual level (look at the use of “be like” in memes, for example) rather than to be designed by philosophers.
...
Having incest fantasies (common in white and Asian people apparently from what I’ve seen on the porn side of the net), along with fixating on exes, indicates an unhealthy desire to return to the womb. On the other hand, “blacked” and bestiality fantasies indicate a desire for the powerful, primal, and untamed. Though uncomfortable with my blacked fantasies, it seems to be a better direction to head in than my incest fantasies (which start occurring when I’m around my mother and sister.) Neither fantasy were consciously manufactured, and are frequently rejected by my conscious when they enter my imagination, but return as frequently as they’re shooed.
...
What if Ganon didn’t literally capture the princess, but captured her heart? Same with Bowser
There have been many jokes about this, too. This could tie into the “blacked” fantasies of America.
From this perspective, however, this could suggest a critique of the modern m0ythos, Zelda and Mario (a current trend in porn seems to be Link and Mario having penises that pale in comparison to “the bad guys”. Though the frame in Zelda closely resembles Christianity, Christianity is also a dying or dead religion. It could be that Zelda is a step closer to the integration of Christ and Satan, but still no cigar. This could be why I’ve stuck to Falcon instead of Link in Smash
...
Shamans and philosophers are generalists that act similar to traffic directors. I have the imagery of SpongeBob directing traffic

### Jan 12
Watching Beta64 play an IQ test, I realized that I probably developed an obtuse vocabulary because it's rewarded on the tests, despite having no real reason to remember them. For example, one section asked the tester to identify from a list of ~15 words which ones have similar meaning. That is, one is rewarded for knowing all the different ways to say the same thing, like knowing 10 alternatives to the word "novice". 
Consequently, people like Jacob, Mattie and I probably all opted to use unnecessarily complex words (having no significant difference in meaning) like "humongous" instead of "big" to indicate intellectual prowess, like how playing an etude can demonstrate technical ability but usually has little artistic value. Some of my peers recognized this when I did this, hence the criticism of "pseudointellectual" -- something that appeared to be smart, but was more just a front. I didn't become explicitly aware of this until I watched that CoC video analyzing Trump's rhetoric and came across JP. 
It's no surprise that school taught us to be superficially smart, but this recent realization means that even IQ tests (or some of their most common forms) are similarly biased

The meningitis vaccine was available since the 1970s, but didn't begin to be adopted as a requirement until 1997. Florida didn't include it as a requirement to enter universities until 2002, 5 years later

On the other hand, the argument that vaccines are designed to weed out those who do not obey to authority is weak because do you know what else is mandated and enforced? Wearing clothes

While I'm at home, I have access to my PC, meaning I could do some Android dev while I'm here. While I probably won't have time to create an integration between my phone notes and my flash drive files, I could tweak Scarlet Notes to make it easier to navigate, and also make it easier to transfer to my laptop. (Update 1/20/22: While I was able to find and implement a promising integration between PC and Android (noice!), it turns out that editing Scarlet Notes was way harder than looking for a different product.)


### Jan 14
A more accurate way to describe the frequent fantasies that have plagued me when around my mother and sister is Freudian nightmares rather than fantasies. Fantasies usually have the connotation of being consciously desired or identified with

It seems that digital corporations will become the modern government, or centralizing political force, as we digitalize
Led to this idea from thinking about how toll enforcement wouldn't be handled by the govt as we know it if we no longer had physical home addresses but emails instead

City of Miami will be governed by Google
Twitter will be the schoolyard of public forum like in Athens and the layout of the site will be structured by a vote system (assuming a democratic digital corporation)
Perhaps this is why Ive been so concerned about digital corps acquiring so much data: because theyre looking to become the next government and an authoritarian one at that

Google may be akin to the Great Britain atm, and Linux/the FOSS movement is like the Patriots in the American Revolutionary War

Crypto may be defunding the current State as power transfers to digicorps as the new State

I think what people think of when they think of dream in "follow your dreams" is a consciously manufactured idealism
But follow your dreams means pay attention to your unconscious and live accordingly in the Jungian sense
In the first sense of the word, the dreamer is likely to be disappointed because they only found the path worth pursuing because of a pot of gold at the end
In the second sense of the word, the dreamer is likely to enjoy it because the pot of gold is the path worth pursuing

Problems with pandering to the crowd and trying to maintain a cool vague persona could be an identification with the persona problem
...
I have concluded that my fixation on my exes is a result of no current Eros to fill my desires and no effort to find one, so I find myself looking backwards

When my exes appear in my mind, it is often accompanied by a resentful fantasy that claims I was righteously loyal and devoted while they were quick to move on, as well as not following through on promises (as mentioned earlier, I l've come to dislike promises as a concept because they can be a conspiracy against the future, and hence, life)

I think I try to imagine myself as a lonesome samurai like Samurai Jack, but that may be the fantasy of men with mother complexes. The allure of black culture as a symbol is the call to aggression and expansion: to dive into life and fructify the world
Simply put, Samurai Jack got no bitches (in the original series, at least)

So, I might be down to instead be a womanizer, but the last big obstacle in the way is my insecurity of dick size. Im statistically about average, which is considered small. I dont know how to change this without doing sometjing like surgery, which may seem silly and shallow but physical reality still matters so long as we continue to mainly live outside of the digital world.

Working with my glasses led me to develop a newfound appreciation for how reliable inventions have to be in order to work
If I could get the 3d print to work + stabilize them, my glasses would be significantly harder to break than standard ones. E.g. mine would likely survive a 100ft drop, whereas normal ones might not even survive a 10ft drop

Since I split my flashlace into my flashlace and my phone, I could also start backing up side A to side B on a weekly basis, making it less likely to lose more work. It should be convenient because my backup is around my neck instead of being relatively large and inaccessible like my external SSD. Additionally, A has a low file size, meaning it should be a quick backup
(I should also still encrypt my external SSD)

The fact that I am finding more niche applications seems to mean that my life is becoming more complex as I take on more responsibility. Or I could say that my house has been in need of a more competent architect because it is turning into a palace

### Jan 21

I noticed that I felt friction in getting a sponsor for Smash. I didn't understand why, and then I realized that promoting goods and services that I may not like or have even tried. This cheapens the value of my word in the long term. I might have acquired an acute sensitivity to this from working at Publix.

On top of that, I think as a creative that I would rather be advertising my own products and brand rather than someone else.

Though, it may not mean crossing off sponsors entirely. Rather, it would prob mean that I'd need to be approaching the sponsors that interest me, instead of vice versa. I could see myself partnering with Obsidian, JPU (LOL), or DrainGang

I see myself as an entrepreneur, not as a vessel for other entrepreneurs

...

I'm thinking that this road trip can be a way for me to attract attention, but I also might just want to keep it to myself and talk about it afterwards. People these days are more receptive to vlogs than writings, but I honestly don't want to show my face doing it. Either way, I'll prob come out of it with interesting experiences to recount, and a post-hoc telling may be more genuine because people don't usually record videos of themselves in actually dangerous situations

With the current state of COVID x Smash, plus the rapid advancements in metaverse stuff, I'm thinking about cutting this journey a bit shorter than I expected to ~6months or less and finding housing in a cheap area with good wifi -- that's all I need, really. I could become a digital nomad and live in Thailand, but I'd rather stay in the states a bit longer so I can have access to cool things like Amazon Prime and new innovations like 3D printers.

When I come back, I want to specifically focus on 3D printing stuff, psychedelics research, metaverse building/research, and cyber security. My optimistic philosophizing could also work, and it's one of the areas I'd be most interested in monetizing, because it's one of the most meaningful things I've done that can also positively impact others, on top of having a lot of content for it already

I hypothesize that people are getting into One Piece recently because of the masculine essence portrayed by Luffy that our society desperately needs in current times

...

Of course. I finally get it.

Alcohol is a disinhibitor

Drunk Rock Lee is the allure of disinhibition to people (perhaps particularly children) who are inhibited. According to JP/Farrell, fatherless children are inhibited. Intuitively makes a lot of sense

While drunk, you are visited by the spirit of disinhibition, but it is not integrated into your personality

Drunk Rock Lee as an occurrence in Naruto's plot makes sense, because Rock Lee is very polite and respectful, but perhaps too much so. Reading it a few steps further, Rock Lee could be a self-insert of East Asian culture (judging by Lee's looks and heavy influence from Bruce Lee) and critiquing itself from the standpoint of a Japanese author. This could be why Rock Lee never amounted to much, and the author instead centered the story around Naruto, a character with an arguably more "American" spirit

"Under Guy's leadership, Lee has acquired a number of his sensei's personality traits: he is energetic, optimistic, and hot-blooded, and  shows the epitome of a "nice guy"...Lee speaks respectfully to others, never using contractions or swear  words and always addressing people with appropriate honourifics (except  his teammates, since Lee feels they are close enough to be spoken to  informally)."

"Why nice guys finish last" - Title of JP YouTube video

Default Lee is proper, respectful, and old-fashioned

He's also the color of green, which is also the color of some of my other favorite, but arguably insufficiently masculine, characters, like Link, Luigi, and Gon

Though, what may separate him from a totally disinhibited "fatherless" child is his strong determination and will to succeed.

Maybe I related deeply to Lee, because I was given a piece of the disinhibition puzzle from growing up doing martial arts and Hanshi as a father figure, but also lacked the same piece Lee did

Im attracted to this symbol, but have also become afraid of my disinhibited self, for I know what Im capable of and have been bottling up (sexual desire, disagreeability, raving, etc.) It could be that I was taught to be afraid instead of accepting by my mother, and therefore I am always anxious because I am always afraid of what I might do

...

When I read about opportunities to become a professional psychodynamic professor and other posts about people having similar thoughts as me (E.g. "What if porn isn't actually bad for our mental health?"), I get excited but also competitive
...
Could it be that people who have grandiose fantasies of themselves are disinhibited people that haven't had the chance to enact such fantasies? E.g. younger me, Jacob, and Mattie

The Bahai Faith has good intentions, but ends up being a naive idealism. They try to rid the world of "judgement" and "bias"
Being nice is not always a good thing, and being mean is not always a bad thing.
"Many Baha’is are Alcoholic (although officially it is prohibited).""
If this is true, this would be somewhat comical but also interesting. I can interpret this fact as Bahais looking towards disinhibitors to find their dark side that theyve desperately tried to repress

Another thing I dont want to admit:
While masturbating, the concept of certain women flash through my head. Sometimes, it's my mother, and sometimes, it's my sister. They're just concepts, and no particular imagery, but it's still disturbing nonetheless, and I push them out of my consciousness. When orgasming the other day, a voice said, "FUCK YOU MOM"
This month spent at home recovering may have come with a heftier cost than expected. I feel as if I've tried to shoehorn a positive relationship with my mother or ignore the negatives of living with my mother for a month but its coming to haunt me

### Jan 27
I feel a bit stressed out. I'm deciding to commit to the social media campaign for my Smash adventure, but I feel like I'm falling into paralysis by analysis. There are so many things I could do, and perhaps I could do something incredibly novel. If I streamed Smash while in my car, I could potentially be pioneering an entire new genre of streaming.
I don't know what to do about my tag. I don't know what feels right. The biggest reason why Id be interested in returning to Cashmere is for its branding appeal. Though, there are people who have names that are different from their @s, like Aris and AvoidingthePuddle
At the end of the day though, let's not forget that even though I'm trying to adjust it to be maximally useful to others, I'm doing this for myself. Despite finding a role to play, I should not forget that I am much more than an actor.

Posted my return on Twitter today. Feeling pretty exhausted. I also have part of my announcement stuck in my head. The part where I essentially said I felt understood, made a false syllogism that those people who misunderstood me were doubters, and then said "fuck em'."
I don't like it because it doesn't make much sense and can lead to me being misunderstood even further
It also felt like I was unnecessarily creating rifts with people who have actually helped me by doubting me, like Xavi, Erik, and Taha.

https://solancha.com/masculine-archetypes-reconnecting-with-the-4-fundamental-energies/

Luffy embodies the archetype of the King
Naruto embodies the archetype of the Warrior

I seem to disturbingly fit in the passive role of the Warrior: Masochist
Lade from years ago: "Falcon mains are masochists"
I pick at my own skin when stressed or bored.
"The passive shadow of the Warrior is the Masochist. He is obsessed with succeeding and doesn’t like to take care of himself. The Masochist feels powerless to change anything in his life. If somebody disrespects him, he will not defend himself. He often feels stressed, overwhelmed by exhaustion, and self-pity. A man of this archetype dreams but never be able to act to make his dreams come true.

Introverted men who grew up without fathers may tend to become masochists because they knew they needed to undergo a ritual in order to become men but had no one to enact it upon them, so they enacted it upon themselves

Men who grew up more extroverted may tend to form gangs and tend towards Sadist

To those who are concerned, I'm doing my research to be safe on this journey, though I'm honestly sick of being told to be safe.
Safety is a virtue, but there are some things in life that are more important than avoiding death.

Lastly, to those who think that Smash is not worth dying for:

Why do you play? Do you really think you sick and just trying to escape a twisted, grim reality? Believe in yourself more.

I suspect that the rise of the Devouring Mother as the dominant archetype is supposed to be a solution to the problem of the danger of our technology greatly outpacing the human capacity to defend from it, leading to the very real current possibility of humanity being destroyed from the push of a button.

While I was walking around the mall in Savannah, GA, a voice inside me said "This is where I belong."

"It is in the old myths that we hear, for example, of Zeus energy, that positive leadership energy in men, which popular culture constantly declares does not exist; from King Arthur we learn the value of the male mentor in the lives of young men; we hear from the Iron John story the importance of moving from the mother's realm to the father's realm; and from all initiation stories we learn how essential it is to leave our parental expectations and find a second father or "second King."
-Iron John: A Book about Men

This book's title reminds me of that name I made: Metal Ra

With my recent move to essentially block my mother from communicating with me for a while and start talking with my father, the description of this intro also reminds me of my recent experiences

...

Remember when I said my father reminds me of Wario?

I would do stuff like playing this very loudly to my sister all the time, but I think it was beaten out of me by my mother (sometimes literally). This energy, whatever it was, appears to now considered "harassment," but was considered something else in ancient times

...

Edit 2/10/22 (not directly editing an entry but seems most relevant here): From an Amazon review of "Iron John: A Book about Men":

"I bought this book, with the thought: "It was written by a man, about  men, being manly!"  I thought this book would be a celebration of men.   But the book is not about men.  The book is about boys and ritual into  manhood, or as I perceive it: "How today's political correct world has  emasculated male energy."  This book talks a lot about "the Mother",  "the Earth Mother" and golden apples.  This book is for today, where  every child is a special snowflake.  Where there are no winners and  losers, because whatever is wrong with you, it's not your fault.  This  book is not about men.  It is a book about the psychology of boys and  teens, and why being weak and emasculated is their true and right  nature.  I was hoping for something like the lore of John Henry or Paul  Bunyan, but instead found only tales about boys.  I find the anthology  of Norse Myths is a better example of "A book about men", or Richard  Marcinko's autobiography: "Rogue Warrior."  If you, or your son, has  "mama issues" then this book will probably help explain it.  It is  articulate, well researched [and] well written.  Just not what I was  looking for.  Thank you."

This is what I was looking to articulate. This male energy appears to continue to be emasculated, with observable ripples in the Smash community. Two of the most prominent CFL figureheads, Riot and Epic Gabriel, were both banned for saying things that are not considered politically correct. Meanwhile, I see in Twitter headlines talks of things like "Don't say gay", a movement which appears to advocate for the removal of the word "gay" from vocabularies in the name of "preventing discrimination."

I'm searching for a positive reason for all of this, but it's felt particularly hard as of recent to support it or be complicit in letting it happen.

The biggest reason why I don't fight it is because I imagine my efforts would be in vain, since the opposition is much larger than me and I would get squashed like an ant instantly and they would move on, like I've seen so many others. The way  someone like Sam Hyde has fought is instead through what might be considered guerilla warfare, infecting the psyche of individuals, like people on the street and strangers on the Internet. I've done some of the latter too, but I've moreso kept to myself.

The reason why I've gotten mixed results with my public announcements about carlife, combined with the intensified negative emotions people currently seem to feel, may be due to a lack of a goal too pair with it. As goals are analgesic, visions and dreams provide positive emotions to people to outweigh the negative. As it stands, most people may view my situation negatively, because it appears to be somewhat done in vain with no end result. There is a large disparity in vision, since I have not mentioned how I have modded my car and my vision for the future of cars.

...

I think the solution to the conflict of men with women might start with their relationship to their mothers. This is certainly the first obstacle I encountered when I attempted to straighten out my life.

...

Haven't had time to write this last week because I've been so busy. But I have some things to sort out.

First, let's talk about my stay at Peab's. In some way, it feels that there isn't much to write about, but what I observed was interesting.

Peab is of Columbian descent, with his parents being first-gen immigrants. Further, all of them are notably very short, which may be an irrelevant detail but I choose to include it because it came to mind, perhaps partly inspired by recent listenings to Sam Hyde's "Billy and the Clown".

Peab is the same age as me, 23, and works from home as an IT worker for Hershey. From what I gather, he's never moved out, and also doesn't live with his father. He  mentioned that he didn't know how to cook for himself, and he began to cook with his mother in attempt to learn, using a meal prep service like Minthe uses. He has pronouns in his bio, and he has that (Snapchat?) filter that puts a crown of hearts around someone to make them look cute. He was very flattered by my comment that he and his family were "very nice." He was fond of Tony, and in many ways was like him. For one, he masked his retarded auditory processing in conversations with affirming "mhm"'s, which he seemed to do almost every other sentence.

When his mother found out about my ventures, she asked in a concerned tone if my parents knew about what I was doing. In response to mentioning that my father knew, and that I had talked to my mother further than a week ago, Peab noted that his mother would likely want something like daily updates if he did such a thing, because his mother hounds him practically whenever he leaves the house.

Observing this family, I began to doubt, feeling I had needlessly destroyed something good in my life. I started to feel that I had pushed away my mother and hurt her for no good reason. This appeared to be a nice, functional family. Why did I seemingly make things so difficult, with the burning of my mother's cards, donation of the Star Wars toys that were so valuable to her, and self-imposed speaking interval regulations? Then I remembered: the truth of these matters is often insidious, like a worm-filled cupcake or a synthetic Krabby Patty. Pay attention to the strings attached.

![](./.media/synthetic-krabby-patty.jpeg)

Though Peab appeared to just be a kind gentleman, there may be more underneath the surface. For one, he plays Mega Man. LOL. Jokes aside, this fact may actually be of significance. I watched Justin Wong's "Art of Lame" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58CV36t3wYA) the other day, and he noted that playing lame and slowly breaking down the opponent through frustration was actually something he enjoyed, which seems to hint of sadism. Though I main Falcon in bracket, a fan favorite referred to in the past as "the people's champ", I've actually enjoyed bullying people as well, with my notorious S4 "B-move Mario" and Ultimate "Tilt Snake".

After my stay, I felt like the pathology of his family had rubbed off on me, as I ended up giving away $5 and my chicken nuggets on an empty stomach to a homeless person that I feel swindled me, as she kept pressing me for more than what I gave. When I gave her my McNuggets, she promptly asked for sauce as if she was no stranger to this situation, and then asked if I could go back through the drive-thru and buy her a soda. I felt like I was being bullied by kindness, and I was reminded of the dark side of compassion. Kindness can kill, and in this case it was killing myself. A tough reality of the world seems to be, "resources must be selectively distributed," and I should be more careful over the sovereignty of my own.

"Would you like to donate $1 to the Helpless Kids Foundation?" I'll be asked in the drivethrough to a Taco Bell. No, fuck you. I just want food. 

For the future, if someone tries pressing me for more than what I give, I should say, either to myself or them, "beggars can't be choosers." I've made this mistake at least twice now: once to that man I drove to downtown Orlando, and now to this lady in South Carolina. I want to ask my dad what he would say in that situation.

Aaron on Twitter: "i hope you can still scare the people in the bowling game"

This may refer to the sadistic impulses of men, which appears to be noticeable in Aaron, Sam Hyde, and myself. I'm not sure, but this may be a separate impulse from resentment as commonly described in the Cain types. Bullies, for example, may not bully because of a troubled childhood (as commonly inferred by intellectuals: see the "School Bully" sketch by Key and Peele), but because of a natural impulse for dominance. The modern myth for bullies is that they're just weak people with deep insecurities, which appears to discourage bullies regardless of how true it actually is. In some way, it's social engineering, or hypnosis, that is collectively and implicitly decided and enforced.

"Falcon loyalist"
"It makes demands on the masculinity of a man, on his ardour, above all on his courage and resolution when it comes to throwing his whole being into the scales. For this he would need a faithless Eros, one capable of forgetting his mother and undergoing the pain of relinquishing the first love of his life. The mother, foreseeing this danger, has carefully inculcated into him the virtues of faithfulness, devotion, loyalty, so as to protect him from the moral disruption which is the risk of every life adventure. He has learnt these lessons only too well, and remains true to his mother."

Giving up Falcon would mean giving up certain privileges, but the privileges are things I don't think I want anymore. I would be able to gather crowds more easily with a more "hype" character, making a name for myself as an unconventional player with an unconventional character. Not the best, but standing out by being different, like NorthernLion in Super Auto Pets. However, I don't want to be an entertainer. I want to be the best at something, and best lotto player doesn't sound very impressive. The best lotto player's success is built on the judgment of others, but the best warrior's success is built on the result of his matches, independent of what the crowd thinks. MKLeo can win a tourney with the lamest character and the game, and will still gain more attention than a hype player like Fatality simply because he's the best.
I started to associate Falcon with being a clown, because of Afro Falcon. I dont want to be a clown or masochist anymore. I want to be a warrior.

The Nine-Tails can be understood as a symbol of the masculine

Naruto grows to be afraid of the Nine-Tails within him, and villagers ostracize him for perhaps being a man because of the things the thing within him (the masculine) has caused: war and destruction
This is similar to how people like me and Tony are afraid to drink because of the things we'd liable to do if we let the masculine side of ourselves loose (like Hyuga molesting Vikki)

Many Americans may be disillusioned to find that retiring at a young age leaves them with an empty void, leaving them to do nothing or pursue meaningless pleasures. Many boomers may have felt betrayed to find this fact out, and may be why many Americans agreed to undertake shitty jobs in the first place. From lowly jobs, like retail, customer service and trash disposal, to more stressful and pressured jobs like being secretary of a high paying company
This is probably why Jeff fought so much against Mary's objections that he needs to still fulfill his role as a father -- the deal was that he was supposed to enjoy a paradise near the end of his life for all the hard work he did when he was younger. The pitfall is that this paradise quickly becomes a wasteland: pleasure island, enslaved to pleasures and a lack of meaning

This transaction -- becoming a cog in a machine in exchange for a mirage of paradise -- may have caused a lot of suffering, but may have been necessary in order to build something greater, like the infrastructure for the digital age

It seems to me that sexual contact, whether in it's unbridled hedonistic form or traditional forms (like marriage) has, in its own warped way; become the socially approved rite of passage for young men in this culture.  That's partly why our society is so subconsciously obsessed with pushing young men into sex, whether through the sexually explicit media, the hedonistic atmosphere of college campuses, pickup artists and self help gurus promoting sex positive thinking or (even) third waves feminists demonizing Incels, etc.  There may be disputes about how sexual interaction is initiated, but nobody (not even metoo feminists) will question the necessity of sex as a step towards psychological maturation.  People literally define their identity based upon their sexual proclivities.  We are not only constantly teased by images of it in the cultural landscape; but we hear the media chanting it's therapeutic benefits day in and day out.


But as far as male initiation rites go, it's a bad substitute.  As the existence of the Incels and MGTOW indicate, many young men are even rejecting this temptation.  Ivy League feminists are baffled: "Sex is so fun!  Why aren't young men doing everything in their power to earn it??"  Because ultimately being a pickup artist is not a fulfilling path to maturity.


It seems to me that, in general, young men develop through external conflict which forces delayed gratification.  This is why old rites of initiation tended to be grueling.  You need a carrot AND a stick to mold young men. The carrot alone (sex) will not suffice. Think about the EPIC OF GILGAMESH-- Gilgamesh and Enkidu had to wrestle throughout the streets of Uruk before they became the best of friends.  Think of chivalry--men fasting and fighting dragons to earn the love of a maiden.  In both of these cases, sex is the distraction; not the actual process to maturity.  Healthy competition with the external world tempers ego, builds confidence, character and maturity.  And once initiated, these behaviors need to be socially reinforced and catalyzed over time--hence the importance of guidance from male mentors.  If young men are not pushed and prodded in the appropriate manner with the right tensions, they will not just "take the bait" by themselves and mature overnight.  Rather, as we're seeing with the male Incels, homeless, etc. they might just drop out of the social game altogether.


And why not?  Going back to the Incel situation, the male role in initiating courtship requires a lot of work and time to learn, money to spend, and immense tolerance for rejection.  It...is...WORK.  Like any tedious, grueling job, men need to be pushed into it.  They need to be guided through it.  They will (generally) not do it of their own accord.  You can't just leave them on their own with a video game console and expect them to spontaneously and autonomously mature overnight (unless they're exceptionally privileged!).  A seed does not grow without the pressure of the blazing sun.  Its far easier for an insecure young man to hide in his room, play video games and watch porn than it is for him to learn the process of courtship with all it's rules and nuances; or even be convinced of its necessity.


To sum it up, I do not think you can "trick" young men into growing up.  You must confront and push them.  This is a role for fathers and other older men.  Otherwise young men may become disillusioned, drift and drop out of the game altogether.  And as Warren Farrell warns "boys who hurt hurt us."

Camille Paglia: "A woman simply is, but a man must become. Masculinity is risky and elusive. It is achieved by a revolt from woman, and it is confirmed only by other men."

"All for one, one for all"
"Ichi wa zen, zen wa ichi"
"All is one, one is all"
One of my favorite anime moments is from the original FMA (ep28). The bunny death scene gave me an entirely new perspective on animals, and one that seems to be shared by the masculine essence and picked up on by artists like Sam Hyde
The idea seems to be covered in videos like this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpaojwsv9xM
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/EFcxvvhjs30

So apparently, a TO named Sebastian is interested in covering my story for an Esports journal. He also mentioned Washington Post, but I forgot what the context was. He invited me to talk with him more at the Mad Meteor tourney he's hosting on Monday.
Seems like a pretty cool opportunity. I prob shouldn't expect much out of this, because my story would first need to be approved, and then I'd need to 
This is almost exactly what I was looking for, though. Someone else documenting my adventures, because adventures with real risk are often recorded through a secondary source or in retrospect. This is simply because the primary source is too busy dealing with the actual risks to document their actions in real time or sell their actions to an audience. When I think of fake "risky" videos that work well as clickbait, I think of YouTubers who record themselves walking through "haunted" forests, staged escapades, or other traversals through sterilized environments. 
With that out of the way, the most important part of this is choosing how to present this. Sebastian suggested I have 5,000 words before what I'm doing can be made into a story, and I also assume that pictures would be of interest, particularly of my face and of my car (interior/exterior).
Like I've said before, I feel that I am exploring multiple problems and themes concurrently.
I could compare my current endeavors to past dramas or travelouges, like "Hatchet" or "Down and Out by Paris and London".
Lastly, what would be good for me to get out of this? A Twitter @ linked at the bottom of the article so I can get <100 new followers? General exposure of a face that people will forget about in a week? A product, perhaps a self-published travelogue, that a handful of people may buy? I don't consider my thoughts to be particularly profound, nor do I have a gallery of pictures that documented my journey. The most meaningful value I can prob provide may be my insights or the meaning of my actions. 
This just seems like a slightly upscale version of being interviewed for a school projected, though.
Obviously, I would like to be rewarded for doing something dangerous and risky, so I probably would not be content with just planting a seed in the American psyche, later harvested (i.e., monetized) by others.
I might receive something else altogether, but the above mentioned ideas are the most realistic outcomes I can think of. Perhaps praying may help me generate a new perspective.
Well for one, I may find some interesting connections of like-minded people.

Today, I found out that my mother asked middle-school-aged Lauren to report to her what she saw on my Instagram in high school.

Combining this knowledge with the Star Wars incident, and the idea explored in Billy and the Clown of Billy's mother watching her son's life through a hidden webcam, I realized that there may be a good chance that my mother has tabs on my Twitter.

In fact, is it possible that my mother has been secretly stalking me on social media for years, even to this day? She seems skilled in the basics of Internet searching, because she found my Star Wars Ebay posting within a week of posting IIRC. I'm also reminded of that time an unknown source sent a message to myself on Facebook, saying "Make sure you log out in all the right places :heart:"

What can be done to separate mother from son in the digital age?

In other news about lack of boundaries between mother and children, I also found out that Lauren became my mother's confidant when I wore pink in high school. My mother apparently "freaked out" in reaction to this, thinking that I may be gay.

This Sebastian guy is interested in creating a 45 min documentary on my recent and near-future life. Furthermore, he seems to actually understand what I'm doing with this venture. Though, I have a feeling that they're more interested in creating a pity party than a documentary on something actually optimistic. 

People like MemeAnalysis are who I feel I was before my transformation in 2021: Cynical about the foreboding digital landscape that was doomed to either fail or be Hell, and attempting to return to tradition. Return to monke, if you will.

I did try that in 2020, only to find that not only am I naturally suited for the natural world compared to others, but that the modern world is not built around traditional lifestyles and is increasingly being built around the digital world. Many people conceptualize this as a conspiracy, blaming the wealthy elite for forcing them into a mode of living that benefits their oppressors. Though I agree that we've been cast into a psychological hellscape of chaos, perhaps accelerated by motivations both good and bad, I came to conclusion that not only does it have to be bad, but it can actually be exciting and epic.

I'd say emotional support, but it felt like she was annoying me more than I wanted to talk with her. It feels like I'm taking care of a giant baby, that I have to pay attention to, whereas I don't really mind if I get attention from them or not

After 2 days of MD/VA, I already miss Georgia. The guys here not only are weaker players, but they also are more bitchmade. Without the bullying force present in GA, things like physical raging seem to go unchecked here. There was also a Falco player that was apologizing for camping/playing lame after I beat him yesterday. Like what? It's a competition, camping and playing lame is fair play.

Lastly, there seems to be a weaker sense of community here. The regions are weak and far apart. The players don't seem to hang out after bracket, like GA players going to Mazzy's after Flashback Fridays.

Being at a Smash Summit seems like it'd be like attending one of the best fests possible with a house tournament, but a required participation in a silly game show in order to participate. I'd be forced to be an actor in order to attend the rest, which seems silly and a waste of time.

...

One thing that is failed to be captured in animes is the horrors of reality, leading anime to often be a highly idealized version of reality, unlike the longer lasting, legendary stories, like Hansel and Gretel, and the Bible. This is one thing I don't like about anime, because it often feels sheltering, almost like the paradise of a mama's boy or an overprotected child. However, there are some that can capture horrors of reality, like FMAB, and others that are worth watching for their essence of character, found in shonens like Naruto and One Piece. Still more, others can be commentaries (sometimes abstract) on life, like Mob Psycho, FLCL, Welcome to the NHK, and Paranoia Agent.

The more I think about it, the more I believe that the single biggest impediment/opportunity for improvement in the near future is boundary creation between people on the Internet.

I realized that playing a gambling game like Super Auto Pets and compulsively browsing Twitter/Discord might be my own version of drugs. Y'know how a lot of homeless people use drugs to take the edge off their shitty living conditions? SAP and social media seem like my drugs. I don't want to live like this though, because I go through a cycle of binging, getting disgusted with myself, and then purging by deleting the apps or trying to "get clean." All the while I'm not doing anything particularly productive. Twitter seems more interesting just because of how much information is on there, but SAP -- at least the way I play it, ignorantly -- is essentially gambling.

Honestly, I'm growing tired of living the way I am. I woke up in a Montessori children's school parking lot this morning simply because I was too tired to drive anywhere else -- I was too tired to even put up the window covers.

So when I'm hungry, tired, and haven't showered in 3 days, the idea of living in a place with running water, electricity, A/C and cooking appliances sounds wonderful.

It's not to say I'm condemning the nomadic or cardwelling lifestyle. Rather, I am becoming painfully aware of my car's limitations, as well as the gap between my car and cars that are more suited to cardwelling, like second-gen Priuses. In this way, I feel demotivated to fix problems in my car because I know that as long as the heart of my car -- the engine -- runs on gasoline, I will likely still hit a wall further down the road, or complicate my setup by investing in alternative solutions, like solar power. Basically, it's like: why try to turn a house into a mansion when I could just buy a foundation that is more suited to a mansion?

I would also rather just design a car that has a driver's seat desk built-in than a cheap add-on for my current car's steering wheel.

Further, I started thinking about the bigger picture of this: is this lifestyle scalable? Is it economically viable? Etc. I can see a big future for living in electric vehicles, but I think cars that are as small as subcompacts just have their limits. Eventually you get tired of not being able to sit up in your own bed, or of being forced to go into a public area if you want to just stretch your body. This is not to say that a low-to-the-ground design doesn't have its perks, and maybe future vehicle could have multiple "modes", like how the back of Tesla's Cybertruck can raise up a foot or two.

I'd be interested in designing something like a livable electric vehicle, but I am not an engineer, and it would likely take me years to become one. I'd rather be a bigger picture guy like Musk than one of the engineers working for him, though. Although, I could see the perks of an engineer: not worrying about having to manage any of your companies, getting a great income, and doing hobby projects in spare time.

...

Talked with my father again last night. I felt like I was in shambles yesterday, but his description of his life made me feel better by comparison. It honestly feels a bit pathetic to see him like this.

It's interesting that he says to want love and affection from women ("not even sex"). I think I've managed to deal with these feelings with easy access to porn and fantasizing about women I don't have an intention of dating -- often with lurking their social media, to be honest.

I think one thing my father doesn't understand that I haven't been able to articulate until recently is that I suppress my anger because expressing it is punished by modern society. So when people might even want me to get angry in a conflict just to get the conflict done and over with quickly, I just keep it inside because it allows me to not get baited, if you will. Think of Light and L playing mind games with each other in Death Note. Expressing emotion shows weakness, but in real life, suppressing it comes at a cost.

...

My mom wrote love notes/letters to me every day until early middle school. My father apparently received the same kind of notes until they divorced. If I started receiving notes when my father left, what does that make me? A surrogate husband?

Now that I think about it, I remember going through my notes shortly before I destroyed them and noticed that the daily  paragraphs I received weren't always paragraphs, but instead just a few words and a picture. I bet the notes started to get longer right when my parents divorced.

...

On sycophants:

On one of my rougher nights in Georgia, I found myself concluding that Falcon wasn't good enough and that I needed to switch to a better character soon. I found my resolve in this to feel pretty sound -- that is, until the very next day.

I went to Fatality's while he was campaigning for some Falcon dittos -- and I was immediately rewarded for playing Falcon. His chat was full of sycophants -- most notably, Stache, guy who complained a lot at Georgia locals. The longer I had contact with this guy, the more he metaphorically sucked my dick. The thing is, I wasn't even all those things he claimed I was. I was not a player who held forward -- I only did it because he wanted me to hold forward or else I would risk getting called lame or him making a big deal out of it. But rather than speak up and put more of an effort past a few weak "stops", I let him continue to build this character of a player who was more hype than I really was. I stopped IDJing in GA, but he continued to say that I went for IDJ combos just because I was a sick player and not because it was optimal. It annoyed me, but in some way I didn't want to put enough effort into the social aspect of tourneys because I was mostly focused on winning.

This was most likely unhealthy for me. So, what to do? I may be able to measure how much of a people pleaser I'm being by how little thoughts I have to write, or how quiet my inner monologue is. Paraphrasing JP, people pleasers drown out their inner thoughts and listen to the crowd, magnifying their grandiosity to compensate.

Then, I began to think. Have there been any other significant cases of sycophantry in my life? It dawned: my mother was in some way like this, especially when I performed, like at karate. The mother probably skews towards this behavior in all mother-child relationships, and the father is probably supposed to be the one that checks his ego, or in some way, bullies the child.

The condemnation of any expression of rage (e.g. at gaming events) may be directly linked to the centralization of humanity (specifically, the dissolution of boundaries between social groups (developmental groups (e.g. kids, teens, young adults, elderly), and other social groups, like men, women, and children) through the Internet. There are no boundaries between men, women, and children at Smash tourneys and Smash Twitter, for example.

...

Recently, when thinking about how to improve my carlife, my thoughts have been dominated by Priusdwelling. The two most significant problems with my current carlife, lack of HVAC and lack of convenient access to enjoyable, filling, healthy food, are remedied by the Prius, at the cost of less stealth (the AC system requires the engine turn on and off for a couple minutes occasionally, if I understand correctly). Further, a Prius that's about as in good shape as my car can apparently go as cheap as $5k. So, is it worth $5k to invest in an asset that will depreciate but significantly upgrades my solutions to two necessities of my life (food and shelter) for at least 4 months? Not sure, but I sure am getting tired of being too cold to work on my laptop and struggle going to sleep in 20 degree weather, or being woken up by my car reaching 80 degrees the next day (or during summer nights in Florida, waking up at night in 100 degree weather). I'm tired feeling how damp my driver seat's armrest is when I wake up the next day, requiring a few hours in direct sunlight to dry out.

I'm tired of eating cold sardines and cold Chef Boyardees. Not only is the food not the best for me, but also it's not even prepared correctly.

Also, the Prius HVAC system would solve the problem of sound passing too easily between my car and the outside world when I crack open my windows. No longer would I have to listen to the wind whipping through cracks, crackheads yelling near my car in the early hours of morning, or general traffic noises. I would also be more comfortable making noise in my car, like playing music.

(As an aside, I'm also sick of having a slow workflow, bound by slow mobile workflows (i.e. trying to work on phones) or slow computers and slow internet, but those are somewhat separate problems)

If I had more money to spend, I would take the prospect more seriously. Further, I don't have means to access the hottest market for used cars (FB Marketplace), I'm not in the state where my current car is registered, and I don't have a residential address that I'm willing to use (not sure if the last two points matter).

If I had even more money, getting a small van or an SUV would seem like a mansion. Theoretically, I'd want to be completely self sustaining aside from water supply and food, where I could do my own laundry and shower in my own house. 

...

On separating children from their mothers in modern times:

Back in the tribal days, a common way for a boy to be separated from his mother was to be taken into the wilderness alone and not come back until he had survived for several months on his own or had achieved a notable feat, like killing a lion. I've already mentioned before how modern men don't have this rite of initiation, and how I liked the idea of deliberate separation of communication from mother from son, but a workaround to this for the mother is to check on the son through a third party. This is one aspect of the Internet/digital technology that has disrupted our interpersonal dynamics, and is mentioned in the Oedipal nightmare hinted at in Sam Hyde's "Billy and the Clown", where Billy's mother spies on Billy throughout the day through a webcam she hid on his shirt. This is also depicted in Black Mirror's "Arkangel".

Well, so what if the mother can spy on her child if she wishes? She at least doesn't have direct contact to the child (let's say in theory, where she is unable to post online but is able to access websites like Twitter and Ebay.) Though the child's psychological wellbeing may be restored, this still leaves the mother with an unhealthy obsession with the child, unable to psychologically separate herself from the child, and leading her life to revolve around the child even when they are not near. In cases such as mine, my mother may justify her spying on me with the fact that she is my invisible benefactor. She has not contacted me in several months but continues to pay my phone and car insurance bills.

With this technology, how could the mother be stopped? If the son reveals himself publicly on the Internet, this also means he leaves himself open to be seen by the mother. What are you gonna do, take the mother's access to Internet away from her? How are you going to enforce that? The phone is quite concealable, and the Internet is invisible and permeates most barriers.

I'm tired of seeing beggars, especially as I've become more aware of the options available to these people. Even then, supposing they are of honest words and have drained all of their known resources, I have myself to worry about first before these people. Remember the lesson from FMA: all is one, one is all.

The best option would be to hand out information cards about resources for homeless people, or fix the problem at a deeper level. These people may be grifters, but I've learned from my father that grifters may not be of impure intention. Rather, it is a sign of a deeper flaw in society. For example, my father justifies scamming his ex-wives because he genuinely believes men get the short end of the stick in modern relationships (which I can definitely understand.)

I can make it a goal to say no to all beggars while in NY. I can ask my dad how he reacts to beggars

From a Reddit thread:

"The number one rule of NYC is "always pretend like nothing is  happening." Literally the only way to avoid it is to remain completely  unaffected, not saying anything or looking around aimlessly, or showing  any reaction at all."

This is how I started treating the Taco Bell beggars in MD. But what about beggars that get in your face, like that woman who came to my window while I was waiting for food in the drivethrough? "Fuck off"? "No, sorry" and then "Go away, I meant it" if they stay?

"Comfort insulates people from the need for adventure" - paraphrasing JP

Another example of my hidden disagreeability: my disobedience in school (it started insidiously when I met Heather and continued through senior year of HS pretty much. I wouldn't outwardly express it but just avoid the situation, like when Sarah kept bugging me to do the silly Santa Claus impression when we were out looking at Christmas lights)

...

Perhaps people like Angel and I were outgoing as children but turned shy as we aged because we  didn't have a father that advocated for the child's outgoing desire. (At the moment, I think Jeff is playing this role in response to my mother and aunt. It probably gives him something meaningful to do rather than just aimlessly browsing social media, LOL)

Coupled with the reduced birth rate, and the fear of death due to a loss of religion, children have become much more precious individually to their mothers

...

Out of region players seem to have been responding very positively when I tell them of my adventurous ambitions. It could be that they dream to break free of a similar Oedipal complex or lake of comforting sludge. As discussed with a couple of players at The Ladder, normal players have no necessary reason to improve at the game, but I must improve if I am to survive. They probably thought such an idea was interesting, since they brought it up.

Overall, I seem to be gaining more support as the journey goes on because I've proved that I can survive in my car and compete at a high level in foreign areas.

The reason why athletes have coaches is because it's beyond human capacity to maximize both execution and strategy. Chess players don't need coaches (though they often have them anyways) because there is little execution in chess. In sports, the skill floor is much higher

The high skill floor of sports is outsourced to athletes, so coaches focus on the strategy

Therefore, I do feel a bit betrayed by Tony for mostly leaving me alone for the month of March. He specified that he was coming back in March, but he waited until the very last day of the month. He hasn't responded to my Twitter messages, either.

Long term, I don't see myself wanting to be a middle-aged Smash coach, or an athlete (because I don't like being dependent on someone for a strategy)

I'm gonna be honest, I'm having a lot of resentful thoughts against Tony rn

To me, Bladee's music is a no-holds-barred view into the unconscious, where illogical self-contradiction and free associations lay bare (similar to XRA). Perhaps it was elicited through the help of drugs, but the barrier of the conscious that often filters rap and holds it back as an artform was dissipated. A necessary dissipation, as the unconscious has been disrespected (often referred to as the "subconscious") and, in a way, damned, by the scientific mind (think of Tony types, for example)

Why do people attach their identities to the character they use? Did people do something similar with the weapons they used in the olden days, or is this a more nuanced development?

People stake their lives on these characters. What does it mean?

Am I merely crowd pleasing, or detecting something that everyone acknowledges?

The reason I play Falcon isn't because the crowd wants me to. I play him because he's the heart of Smash.

Sure, you might not be able to stake a living off of being a high level mid-tier main, but people will support you regardless because of what you do. Though the best of a domain gets the most attention, the Falcon player gets invited to play the most number of games. People simply don't want to play against Joker in friendlies because it's not as fun as fighting Falcon.

What is the cost/benefit of using a moniker as an artist?

I've gotten to the point where I can confidently look someone in the eye and tell them I live in my car

...

At my lowest point in my survivalist ventues, I realized I played Falcon because he fulfilled the soul, and I needed it

I was torn between marketing my escapades this year as genuine struggles and competitive growth and doing what Shayan suggested and turning it into a business venture. I felt that making it into a business was inauthentic, because I wouldn't be incentivized to practice if I was profiting off my art/business/ but perhaps the real struggle was required to make it real

Tony telling me not to tell anyone about carlife is like telling an artist to not share his art

Planet Fitness, 6000 Mahoning Ave Unit 510, Austintown, OH 445515

This is the best PF I've been to in a while

Seems like PFs with ratings of 4.3 and above are excellent quality

...

I'm honestly ready for a break so I could reorganize myself, chill, get good rest, and eat good food. A month would do wonders

There are also so many things about my current lifestyle that I'm tired of.

I'm tired of my car being damp -- the offputting smell, and the uncomfortably moist feeling of laying my elbow on the driver's armrest -- and the anxiety of thinking that I might be doing long-term damage to myself by living in it

I'm tired of having to unpack and repack all my toiletries every time I want to shower

I'm tired of living in such a small space

I'm tired of not sleeping on a flat surface, and I'm angry at my father who neglected me for most of my life for not helping me build a surface for a working bed, despite driving all the way to his place for that main reason and him not telling me til the very end

I'm tired of having limited access to electricity

I'm tired of eating expensive or shitty food

I'm tired of not having a PC

I'm tired of being woken up in a sweat by the beating sun or by the freezing cold

I'm tired of hearing people passing or car alarms all-too-well as I have my windows open to (barely) air out the car

I'm tired of my Bluetooth radio making a constant buzzing noise

I'm tired of my best friends leaving me for dead

I'm tired of having to do my own coaching since mine abandoned me

I'm tired of my back car windows being blocked out which makes it harder to nav

I'm tired of my slapshod car inventions falling apart, and the main reason for them being slapshod is that I don't have a space to workshop in

These have all makde me very tired and wanting to just do nothing instead of journey forward

Many of these problems could be solved by getting a new vehicle, but I would have to go through the stress of buying and registering a new vehicle, and in particular, may have to go through my mother in order to do so.

My middle back hurts incredibly bad

I could really use a deep massage at the end of all this

My body aches, I have a fever, I have a headache, and it feels like I have a million thoughts happening at once

It felt like my mind was buzzing with static interference and hence made me retarded and delusional

I felt like I was having multiple lines of incoherent thought at once while also being delusional as previously mentioned (e.g., I thought that this intense headache was the test to enabling psychic powers)

I tested positive for Covid

Day 2 Check-in

The virus has been reduced to just my head

Last night it was a milder headache/fever and a slightly sorer throat

This morning is an almost unnoticeable headache/fever, a much sorer throat, and a bit of congestion

Day 3

Throat hurts like shit

Congestion is worse

Headache/fever seems gone

The urge to avoid swallowing is so bad that saliva keeps building up in my mouth

The body aches I got from Covid showed me that my center back is not really supported by my bed

This so-called revolutionary tech that Gimr showed, the "Slingshot", is one of the stupidest things I have ever seen and has wrought a mass psychosis unto Smash Twitter. The convoluted presentation of a tech found weeks into the game's release was an Emperor's New Clothes situation. Emperor's New Tech

Couple this with Gimr's Twitlonger the other day martyring himself over a Pound commentator mistaking a player's gender, and I am led to believe that this person is way less competent than I expected. He seems too sensitive, agreeable, and focused on himself/his brand to be a good leader.

It's actually dangerous to mingle with women

As one Twitter user puts it, they're a "liability"

This is exactly what it feels like. Men don't approach women not only because they have porn as an alternative, but because interacting with a woman gives them the chance to cancel you if they feel like it. This is what the "I don't talk to women I'm scared" jokes refer to.

This is probably why I just avoid interacting with women but stalk them on Twitter

Josh Peck is a lot of forced enthusiasm

Drake and Josh seemed to have internalized their acting roles, since Josh seems constantly worried about his body even when he doesn't need to be, and Drake became upset when he saw Josh become hot (joked "I was supposed to be the hot one")

Part of this may be due to using the same first names in the show as their real names. Also they started acting at a young age, so their real life identity probably became blurred with their actor identity while teens undergo a massive identity formation in that age

It also feels as if the humor of the actors in real life is like based on the writers of the shows they were in

### May 27

Why am I in such a bad mood right now? Everything I'm missing in friendlies is pissing me off and I'm not being friendly to new or old faces

Some potential reasons:

-I'm frustrated by the GCC and that my performance is degrading as I transition to the F1, all the while people have more expectations about my performance at this event than at my previous major

-A lot of minor annoyances in daily living that sum to major frustrations

-Unsocialized Smashers clamoring around me and trying to socialize while I don't want to talk to anyone and just play Smash. I'm taking this event as a serious tourney, not as a recreational vacation

-There's a rift between Tampa Smash and I, most notably between Erik and me

-I'm hungry

In a sense I feel like I'm pushing everyone away, but that might be a side effect of being a disagreeable and introverted person. I can't tell yet.

White people like memes -- paraphrased Sam Hyde

White people, or perhaps more accurately, Western civilization have become possessed by the trickster/joker archetype, perhaps in reaction to the many dehumanizing aspects of modernity (working as a wageslave in gray cubicles). The obsession with the Joker can be seen in the Batman portrayal, with appearances in blockbuster movies like The Dark Knight and Joker. Further, Western society seems to be the place where meme culture is the most prevalent. Artists like Bladee also seem to have a fixation on the Joker archetype, which the underground American scene has come to love

On carliving:

Really, the biggest thing screwing me right now is lack of AC. The problem of food being expensive, though not necessarily a problem because I can enjoy myself by eating out at new places (and justify it by saying it's helping the economy), could be solved through an electric/hybrid car, and the problem of my bed being shitty can be solved just by making an actual bedframe.

The problem of inefficient work in my car could also be solved through VR workspaces, too.

The only problem after that would be finding a place to park for long periods of time, though I'd prob be able to get away with stealthcamping in any public parking lot, especially in places like the library. (Concept: futuristic libraries would be more like an indoor/outdoor town square with loads of parking spaces, as dedicated quiet spaces, meaning enforced silence. No music, no radios louder than 20db, etc.)

Carlife has really been wearing on me, and I've been performing poorly in Smash due to poor organization in my personal life. But this does not mean carlife as a whole is a lost cause.

If anything, this could give me motivation to earn the ~6-7k apparently needed to buy a good Prius.

Though, I heard you still need to crack your windows on a Prius to prevent monoxide poisoning. I don't get it though, because isn't that what a system that flows air between the outside and inside designed to prevent?

The study rooms at the Richardson Public library have unlimited time allotments. This shit is broken, I can essentially live here and practice Smash/work all day.

A player I met had a habit of uncontrollably shitting himself in high school and he doesn't know why. He shakily recounted the story as he fought back tears. I didn't try to console him by saying sorry, I just merely said it was interesting. I think he's deeply disturbed by it because it was something incredibly embarrassing and unexplainable, other than that you're a pitiful retard damned to be tortured by life because you didnt win the genetic lottery

"Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people"

IIRC, he said that it happened from grades 9-12. My hypothesis is that he did it to avoid school, because it sounds like he absolutely hated school whether he admits it or not

"Do not listen to people who say that the distinction between friend and enemy is primitive and passe. They are just disguising their fear of conflict behind a front of false warmth. They are trying to push you off course, to infect you with the vagueness that inflicts them. Once you feel clear and motivated, you will have space for true friendship and true compromise. Your enemy is the polar star that guides you. Given that direction, you can enter battle." (Robert Greene – The 33 Strategies of War [1])

"I think" instead of just using statements youre unsure of is more truthful, but less incindiary and therefore less condicive to creating motion and direction. Stating something youre unsure of as a blatant fact is more likely to get someone to help you find a correct answer than saying "Meesa thinky dis might be da correct ansa"

"Czar Nicholas had decided to sentence the Petrashevsky radicals to hard labor soon after their arrest. But he wanted to teach them a harsher lesson as well, so he dreamed up the cruel theater of the death sentence, with its careful details--the priest, the hoods, the coffins, the last-second pardon. This, he thought, would really humble and humiliate them. In fact, some of the prisoners were driven insane by the events of that day. But the effect on Dostoyevsky was different: he had been afflicted for years with a sense of wandering, of feeling lost, of not knowing what to do with his time. An extremely sensitive man, that day he literally felt his own death deep in his bones. And he experienced his "pardon" as a rebirth. The effect was permanent. For the rest of his life, Dostoyevsky would consciously bring himself back to that day, remembering his pledge never to waste another moment. Or, if he felt he had grown too comfortable and complacent, he would go to a casino and gamble away all his money. Poverty and debt were for him a kind of symbolic death, throwing him back on the possible nothingness of his life. In either case he would have to write, and not the way other novelists wrote--as if it were a pleasant little artistic career, with all its attendant delights of salons, lectures, and other frills. Dostoyevsky wrote as if his life were at stake, with an intense feeling of urgency and seriousness."

The biggest question is whether we want to merge into a collective at the sacrifice of our privacy or keep our individualist values

Many of the world leaders seem to lean towards the first formation, which I can't tell if I'm missing something or think is fvalues

One factor that I dont know how fits into the situation is the favt that the world's population is absurdly large relative to what it was. With the internet connecting us, the individual becomes dwarfed and requiring a hyperspecialization to provide value

Seems that self-discipline seems to come with goal setting

I dont think the ability to tyrannize yourself is a good thing. For example, being able to force yourself to go to the gym and get nice abs will crumble under any significant pressure because the reward is shallow and weak for a large investment

The rationale of preventative care also is a bit flimsy, because it's solely an avoidance goal instead of a move-towards goal
The "best version of yourself" is also flimsy because it's vague. Being fit is not the best version of yourself if it currently doesnt have any actual utility

Perhaps a more reasonable mindset is to think about what to discipline yourself towards

E.g.
I would not be as incentivized to go to the gym for aesthetic improvements as I would be to train for a fight

A big problem I think I had with my mother sleeping on the living room couch was that it was fundamentally a dissolution of boundaries

Instead of having her own designated sleeping room, she would sleep in the living room, where she is in the center of the house like a panopticon
This worked against my attempts to sneak out of the house or do things I wasnt supposed to at night, effectively making me surveilled at all points, at all times
She still has this habit years (7-9+) later, and even though I now have the autonomy to do bad things even if she didnt want me to, it makes staying over deeply uncomfortable. I do not have the chance to go into the rest of the house at all without passing her or disturbing her. Not that I care about disturbing her sleep, but that I don't feel alone when I want to be. I cant do something in the house without getting the feel that someone's watching.
When exactly did she first start doing it?

My thoughts are still a bit scattered, but it's oriented around doing, fixing, ordering, or completing things, rather than creating things. It's almost as if I have OCD in this state.

My refusal to acknowledge manipulations of material world in favor of the mental/spiritual has resulted in some ugly scars (namely, the ones on my face via refusal to look to normal acne treatments), but if I broaden my perspective I can find solace. Ease my heart, like the NPCs in MM, if you will... 

Mastery of the human body via supplements may not result in a consumer totalitarian central state, but rather a new single supplement that is to new humanoids what water is to us. After all, we all are water addicts. We're addicted to a material substance, and it's a fact of life. The extremist devil's advocate to this is the mentalist who attempts to not eat, drink, and perhaps even breathe. Similarly, there are mentalists who attempt to avoid death by avoidance of aging. However, these appear to be just attempts to return into stagnation, and the effort has no generative qualities. The attempt to unite body with spirit has led me to discover some painful boundaries but I should not be so stubborn as to outlaw all physical manipulations, for it'd make me a hypocrite at a deeply comical level. "I want to avoid caffeine because I don't want to become dependent on a substance" *drinks water*

Also, my recent slew of cystic acne should give me the takeaway that I should avoid consuming milk. I think it's a safe enough correlation to make.

excess spirituality

I also have been having more normal sleeping patterns, like waking up after 6-7 hours of sleep rather than 9-10. Could it be that my default state expends more energy, and therefore requires more recovery, than this new one?
If this is true with no bad side effects, not only would my integration with society be easier with a higher density of output, but it would also require less of me to recharge

Could this be why I have a sweet tooth? An attempt to self medicate by eating something that acts as a stimulant?

OCD is a masculine trait
Obsession with perfection
Neurotics like Kendall and I are affected by it, sometimes in a self destructive manner. E.g. I would be obsessed with cleaning the "blackheads" in my nose when I was younger, when it was actually just natural skin filaments on the nose, and has fucked up my skin in the long term.
However, OCD also can give rise to great artists and engineer types

Kendall is obsessed with doing things cleanly and optimally in Smash but it makes him predictable
You gotta learn to play dirty, and you can practice getting over your disgust sensitivity to get better at Smash

Women are weavers of self-pity spells, like how Jennette McCurdy's mother convinces her to start acting, or how she would show the family on a weekly basis footage of when she had cancer
I learned to use them as well, like when I convinced my mom to stay home from school repeatedly by making myself look like a helpless victim
I notice that I'll still have thoughts of self-pity, like when I told Tony I was tired of getting taunted on as I was getting waxed by Nerva after spending a year in my car and traveling across the country

Women becoming independent through rational thought may have helped people establish their own mental health but it incentivizes women to not be like women and instead like men

In an ironic way, my experiments with caffeine showed me more about my existence than psychedelics did

Psychedelics, in contrast, felt like I was a meaningful node in the fabric of existence and that we were one entity yet I was seperate

"To him truth, as well as the act of being genuinely true, are timeless and sacred realities that turn our whole illusory world of appearances upside down. They throw us off our comfortable chairs by showing us we are not the personalities we imagined we were: point us back to our true origin, our spiritual source.4 Of course words like this can sound very inspiring. But that, too, is just a part of the illusoriness-because we have managed even to turn spirituality into an illusion so we can protect ourselves from the reality of the spirit."

Today, I feel like the path forward is not to rush my break. I've felt pressured to return to work and/or Smash, but I started to feel like seasons of isolation could be beneficial. It feels right, though I'm not sure if it's sloth or a useful time for self-reflection and restoration of the spirit. Away from the pleasures of the social and physical world, I remember the spiritual
I don't want to seriously talk to Jacob or Tony. I don't want to train Nap or Kendall when they've clearly shown a lack of initiative. No one seems like they want to seriously listen and practice on their own. I noticed myself become more and more desperate to train someone into a competent opponent, going as far as to offer $1 to whoever could beat one of my secondaries in a 2/3. I've come to let it be, and I think I just won't fit in with playing other Smash House players. I feel like I cant fit in, but it's fine, and I shouldn't force it. At the same time, the psychedelic experience I had revealed that all the decisions and my residence here was all part of the right plan, so I need not lament this fact of being different. 
It's time to rest up and dream a new dream
Also worth noting that isolation is not necessarily idleness

"I'll second that and save everyone a trip to YT since there's a lot of bad explanations out there. What I do is grind up the dried mushrooms in a coffee grinder and pour them into a shot glass of pure lemon juice. Mix it up and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Then strain out the solids and drink just the juice. The acid in lemon juice converts the psilocybin into psilocin which is what your stomach would normally do. This results in a much faster comeup and a shorter trip with almost no stomach ache since you don't have to digest things you can't.

As I'm realizing that Project Cosmic Carnival is likely years out of reach, I'm thinking that darkening MM3D with a post processing shader would take the work of a week or less.

Concerning PCC, Im not sure how financially rewarding or sustainable it would be, and I realize that Ive underestimated the technical complexity of game engines and how long it'd take to learn them (my only real technical skill Im decently proficient in is Smash. I have good taste but basic proficiency in most digital media). However, if pursuit of beauty is the goal then PCC still works as a side project, I just cant expect to be at the forefront of new tech as a hobbyist with no technical artistry background and no one who can really help

One person (apparently) made the PC port of Mario 64 a month after the decomp was released. Maybe a PC port of MM wouldnt actually take a year after it was decomped

Decomp takes a lot longer than a port because the former involves a lot of fumbling around and deductive reasoning, whereas making a port involves just removing the code specific to a console and replacing some of it with port-relevant code

Decomp is like completing a 10,000 piece puzzle, and port is like digitizing it

Using a new word I learned, decomp is refactoring game code into human readable code

-Lighting engines: likely won't see any crazy results until the beginning or middle of next year with PCC
-Webdev: Can be used to freelance, which would support the remote lifestyle and full embrace of living fulltime in my room
-Modeling/rendering: Similar to above, but I have less intrinsic interest in practicing this

A big time save for me would be having a cloud that both my phone and my computer reference

If I were to go this method I wouldnt want my data to be sent 
Researching a wireless, local and portable solution led me to think about having a cloud of some sort on you as a necklace. An ultimate form of privacy. Not to mention that it's stylish. It's like those necklaces in anime that actually have powers and arent just a fashion statement (Naruto, Xavier)
Seems the tech for that would be wayyy far away for it to be feasible, but the cloud could be powered by skin heat conduction perhaps
This idea seems like it could be a good compromise between futurist movmeents like cloud computing and individual rights

Shit is just too slow or predictable or whatever. Id want to mod MM to make the narrative faster and denser

I just read a Reddit post about a guy complaining about his wife not respecting bathroom privacy. He mentioned that not only would she enter while he was taking a shit, but she would also leave the door open when she was using the bathroom, and cite forgetfulness when questioned. Upon reading this I was greeted by two memories: one, the sight of yellowed water in the toilet bowl when I went to use the bathroom (either my mom or Lauren used the bathroom and didn't flush), and two, the disturbing image of seeing my mother's bushy pubic hairs as she sat on the toilet as I woke up on her bed (I was prob around 10). She didn't close the door to use the bathroom.

In another post, I read about a guy who caught his wife secretly reading his private journal. This reminded me of the Star Wars/Ebay paradigm shift

Info like this reaffirms that the feminine is the dissolution of boundaries, and the masculine is the creation of then

Jobsearching with a Bach in Psych and no stunning resume for any kind of computer work is beginning to make me feel useless
I might end up lowering my standards as I get more desperate but I don't want to be desperate

My body is decaying, I'm getting older, I have little specialized skill, and I'm ugly asf. If everything is going the way is supposed to, why does it feel so bad?

Dad felt like he was playing an unfair game with one hand tied behind his back

Not sure what the point of the insurance part of the story was

Dad feels like Lauren can see inside the glass house easiwr than I can because our mom loved her less

Dad chose to move to VA with new wife rather than enforce visitation on kids because his wife, his ex-wife, and even his kids didn't want them to see him

Dad isn't very articulate in how he says things (more crude) and people can very easily poke holes in it
"She wouldn't let you guys call me"

Did my mother's side of the family give me a Hero complex? Or am I truly destined for greatness? 

One interpretation of Xavier is that he is a freak  with an Oedipal situation and sees himself as a savior but ends up destroying things 

I would also like to mention it seems that my maternal family puts me on a pedestal yet doesn't respect me when I try to fix the family
Meaning there might be a secret incentive for us to agree on this conspiracy

But on the internet, I can't escape from my family. What am I to do? Create Web3?

I want to cut the digital mother into pieces so I can start living and establish actual relationships with women

"Existing is not a crime!" -Guy from One Piece

Veganism and similar philosophies has led to this endgame. I anticipated this years ago when I thought of the philosophy that existence itself is evil because you are fundamentally taking resources that someone else can use

We're starting to see a backlash in pop culture with memes like being asked to give up a subway seat for a pregnant woman and doing a full split in response

"Hard" and "Raw" are popular words
Fake forced friendliness is reaching its limit and people are starting to embrace unfriendliness and rudeness

Dad advised to get a handgun with 2k rounds (I think) in anticipation of chaos

Could the savior not be a nonviolence advocate like Christ/Lennon/Gandhi figure but a warrior/killer like Luffy?

Fiures like Link are slowly becoming lame and villains like Ganon are being glorified
Like it or not, being black is meta rn

If my maternal family is feeding into my Oedipal complex, it could mean that they're encouraging me to sit and do nothing all day to maintain my infinite potential yet actual nothingness

The beliefs found in books like Eschatology could also feed into this belief that the best way forward is to do nothing

It might be time to give up being a Lee main to become a Jin

I criticize my mother of being a hoarder, but I am digitally hoarding a bunch of files on my external drive

Do I really need my old files anymore? They've has their time, and I should preserve only the things that I think will be useful in the future, like past digital media work

The only reasons for keeping these files are nostalgia, creative potential, and analysis of the past. The feminine instinct is to hoard, but now is a time where we don't need any more hoarders. We need borders.

I could also consider my backup as a digital archive, and more akin to a library of history books to maintain. Idk, I kinda just wanna get rid of the Mario Kart ISOs and old memes

A flaw in Peterson's Peter Pan bad theory:
For one, he doesnt mention how the story ends, which is a happy one (might be Disneyfication but)
Also, sure, Tinker Bell may be the equivalent of porn, but Peterson also neglects his other statement that porn was the primary force to the creation of the Internet

I feel like I keep radically flipflopping between beliefs

Pan is king of the losers, but the losers create something from nothing

The story is almost like it's told from the perspective of Captain Hook

Then again, I don't know how to integrate these ideas into the Chris Chan narrative

In defense of the Internet Neverland boys like Jacob: 
Globalization has led people to become more pigeonholed in their specialties, but also, automation is king.

Seeing this trajectory you could infer that in the future, ideas, taste, and creativity would be more important than technical skills

I think I actually would be interested in travel again but the caveat is that I want a workflow that is very lightweight, fast, and efficient. As efficient or more than someone working in a home office

To accomplish this, I think I would need either expensive gear or extensive skill with software that has high skill floors and ceilings. The latter would be easier since the tech would be more readily available and therefore less precious, meaning I could more easily afford to lose it.


To compliment that I'd also want a workspace to be able to work comfortably and consistently. A van with a consistent place to park for extended hours would work, and so would a library, but ideally with a study room with unlimited time

Mom apparently has 3-4k in her bank account

Only gets paid $19/hr at her job

Doing empty nester activity 

Upset that she can't talk about her problems with us (upset that she can't talk to us about "what she's feeling")

Had a conversation w Lauren roughly 6 months ago that concluded that she'll go to therapy (which is free on her insurance) but never followed up on it
Initially started a year ago and she didn't follow up from there either. Similar to other empty commitments (cleaning garage, cleaning house, garage sale)

I'm really disturbed by this, and I don't know what to do about it

Is there really any way to force her to make more changes rather than just making empty commitments?
I don't care if she doesn't want to better her life and doesn't want to change, it's the fact that it intersects with our lives

Isn't net worth already social credit

"Graeber's thesis is in fact confirmed by recent technological developments like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is in its simplest terms 'merely' an unfalsifiable ledger of who has 'rights' in the community and how much, essentially what members of the community are worth to each other. 

The Bitcoin ledger differs from bank accounts because (among other things) it cannot be interfered with either by criminals or governments. In other words the ledger can be trusted even when its members have no personal knowledge of each other. The social system is its own guarantor."

This is probably the biggest factor. I'm less anti social and more anti (big) government
