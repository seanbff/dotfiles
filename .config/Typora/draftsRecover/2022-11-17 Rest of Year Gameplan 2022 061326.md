I should check my subscriptions to make sure I'm not paying my debt card that expires tomo
Create a better integration between Obsidian and ScarletNotes with version control so I dont keep dealing with the anxiety of potentially deleted notes.
-Features:
-Version control so I can confidently empty my Scarlet Notes recycle bin
-Easy time referencing media: easily move referenced pictures to media folder and remove from Timeline view in Gallery (could also require a Gallery mod. I want to be able to see pictures from hidden folders in Album view but keep invisible in Timeline/photo access view)
-Ability to quickly and easily combine notes of the same category
-Autowriting the date created (month/day) with the correct markdown heading format on the first line of the note
-Autotranscribe YT link title to help remember what the video was if taken down
Either have better workflow on just phone through XR assistance/foldable phone, or improve integration with working on computer (#1 problem is Obsidian's tendency to delete file content when connecting to comp or accessing files simultaneously on phone + comp)
Check Prime and Crunch subs
Switch to Proton Mail app/Tutanota
Try Fediverse/Matrix/Taler/guifi.net

Make a new planner. After creating priority, first organize order tasks by week, then by day
Make a new gameplan doc, with better organization at the 5th resolution
Organize projects by category, and by relevance. Ideally would like to have 2 categories for each: genre/relevant skillsets and priority
Encrypt external hard drive/make a second backup
Create a new TCC doc and change title of old one to 2021-mid 2022
Check for important updates with Obsidian
Test shaders in Unity to match MM artstyle

Tools to consider investing in:
Tatami cotton cover (~50"x75")
Privacy screen
Flexfit Hyken Mesh Task Chair
Portable desk? 
Should be ergonomic too
White blanket



Online tourneys:

Monday: 

Tuesday:

Wednesday: Coinbox, $2000 pot (paid entry),

Thursday:

Friday:

Saturday: GGToor, $100 pot (free entry)

Sunday:

To win the tourneys that are way more rewarding than locals, I will be competing against top 200 or greater skill level. Easier to get the same payout from winning a small local as getting 7th at a tier1/tier2 online tourney, but online tourneys obviously have bigger rewards if you get past 7th. 1st of the Coinbox gets $800, but you'll likely have to fight either Sparg0, Sonix, or Maister, which are top 20-30 level
